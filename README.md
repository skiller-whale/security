# Skiller Whale, Exercises for Core Security

This repo includes exercises to accompany Skiller Whale sessions on Core Security

During each session you'll be asked to write and edit code in some of the files.

Make sure you to put your attendance id in `attendance_id` and have docker running. You can do that by running:

* `docker compose up --build`

The attendance id is used to share your files with the person leading the session, so that they can see the code you're writing, and help out when needed.
